<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">A BRIEF HISTORY OF MIDDLETON PLACE</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02.jpg" id="ncfig1" alt="Middleton Place" width="800" height="679" />
</div>
<p>The land that now comprises Middleton Place lies
in one of the earliest areas inhabited by Englishmen
in South Carolina. In 1674, just four years after the
first colonists settled at Charles Town, Lord Proprietor
Sir Anthony Ashley Cooper granted lands for settlement
along the lower reaches of the Ashley River.
Among these was the site of Middleton Place, deeded in
1675 to Jacob Waight. Waight apparently forfeited his
claim to the tract, and in 1700, it was granted to
Richard Godfrey, who sold it in 1729 to John Williams,
a wealthy landowner and justice of the peace. The
land passed into Middleton hands in 1741, when John
Williams&rsquo; daughter Mary married Henry Middleton, the
second son of former provincial governor Arthur
Middleton.</p>
<p>Henry and his two brothers were the third generation
of Middletons in South Carolina. Their
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
grandfather, Edward Middleton, had arrived in the
colony in 1678 as part of the great influx of Barbadian
Englishmen who made up more than half of Charles
Town&rsquo;s early immigrants. Like many other Barbadians,
Edward settled along Goose Creek, north of Charleston.
His plantations there, along with estates in Barbados
and England, passed to his son Arthur in 1685. Arthur
also inherited a prominent position in Carolina society,
and with it, an active role in the political life
of the colony. Edward had served as Lords Proprietors&rsquo;
deputy and assistant justice in his few years&rsquo;
stay in Goose Creek, but Arthur, who held more than a
dozen public offices, was the Middleton who established
the tradition of political leadership that was
to distinguish his family for four generations.</p>
<p>Probably the most significant of Arthur&rsquo;s
achievements was his role in the overthrow of the
Lords Proprietor. The eight British noblemen theoretically
owned and managed all of the Carolinas, but in
later years, they adopted policies that their colonists
saw as inimical to survival in the American
wilds. Following the Lords Proprietors&rsquo; failure to
provide military aid during the bloody Yamasee Indian
uprising of 1715-1717, Arthur Middleton led a convention
that in 1719 persuaded the king to remove the
Lords Proprietor. Later, as president of the Ruling
Council, he served as governor of the province until
the arrival of a governor appointed by the king.</p>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s son Henry inherited a large share of his
father&rsquo;s estates in Carolina and Barbados and was
reputed to be one of the wealthiest men in Carolina.
According to one contemporary account, he owned some
20 plantations and 800 slaves. Nonetheless, after his
marriage to Mary Williams he moved his residence and
base of operations to his wife&rsquo;s Ashley River plantation,
which they named Middleton Place. The manor
house was already standing at that time, but Henry
added the two flanker buildings (the southernmost of
which now serves as the main house), and laid out the
formal gardens, terraces, and ornamental lakes that
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
made Middleton Place one of the most elegant of the
lowcountry plantations. Rice, introduced into the
Carolinas in the late seventeenth century, had become
by Henry&rsquo;s time a staple crop of the Ashley River
region and was becoming the main product of Middleton
Place (<a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 1. Locator map of Middleton Place,

</div>
<p>Like his father, Henry held a number of public
offices under the royal government, but it was in the
rebellion against that government that he gained political
renown, first as president of the South Carolina
Provincial Congress and later as a delegate to
the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia. Only
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
seven of Henry and Mary&rsquo;s eleven children lived to
adulthood, but both surviving sons were members of the
Provincial Congress, and when Henry&rsquo;s health began to
fail in 1776 his elder son Arthur replaced him as delegate
to the Second Continental Congress. At 34 Arthur
Middleton was the senior South Carolina delegate
to sign the Declaration of Independence.</p>
<p>The American Revolution took a heavy toll on
South Carolina. Several major campaigns were fought
in the former colony, and Charleston and the surrounding
lowcountry were occupied by the British from
1780 to 1782. During this time, 63 leading Charlestonians,
including Arthur Middleton, were imprisoned
in British St. Augustine. By 1780, Henry was seriously
ill, and, like other lowcountry residents, he
and his sons suffered serious financial losses from
the plunder and disruption that accompanied the British
occupation.</p>
<p>Henry died in 1784 leaving Middleton Place and
other plantations to Arthur, who in the postwar economic
climate soon regained his former standard of
living. Arthur and his family of nine children had
lived at Middleton Place for some time before Henry&rsquo;s
demise, and several important economic changes took
place under Arthur&rsquo;s direction. In Henry&rsquo;s early
years at Middleton Place, rice had been cultivated in
inland swamps irrigated with water from man-made reservoirs.
By the late eighteenth century, soil exhaustion
had begun to pose a problem, and many planters,
including the Middletons, changed to tidal rice cultivation
that involved impounding freshwater swamps
along the rivers&rsquo; edges and allowing them to be
flooded by the natural action of the river tides. Not
only did the new soil and nutrients deposited by the
floodwaters remove the threat of soil exhaustion, but
the tidal system was more labor-efficient than inland
cultivation, resulting in higher yield per acre. This
new efficiency was compounded by another late eighteenth
century innovation, the water-powered rice mill,
installed at Middleton Place about the same time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Arthur&rsquo;s eldest son Henry inherited Middleton
Place at the age of 17, apparently while he was still
in school in England. Henry devoted a great deal of
attention to the gardens planted by his grandfather,
enlarging them and introducing many new plants, some
of them newly brought to America by the French botanist
Andr&eacute; Michaux. From 1801 to 1830 Henry was continuously
in public office, first as a South Carolina
legislator and governor, then as a member of the United
States Congress, and from 1820 to 1830 as American
ambassador to Russia.</p>
<p>By the time he returned from his service abroad,
South Carolinians had embarked upon the separatist
agitation that would eventually lead to their third
attempt in 150 years to overthrow a government.</p>
<p>At issue were the 1828 and 1832 &ldquo;tariffs of abomination,&rdquo;
designed by Congress to protect fledgling
industries in the northern states. However, they were
viewed by indignant Carolina planters, dependent on
direct trade with England, as an assault on their
agricultural economy. The South Carolina Nullification
Convention of 1832 declared the tariff null and
void on the basis of John C. Calhoun&rsquo;s doctrine that a
state had a right to vote to disregard onerous acts of
Congress and, if other states found its action unacceptable,
to secede. As a member of the opposing Union
Party, Henry Middleton was perhaps the first of his
family to take an active conservative role in a dispute
pitting South Carolina against an outside governing
body.</p>
<p>This early threat to the Union was deflected with
a tariff reduction in 1833, but the nullification doctrine
had laid the ideological groundwork on which 11
southern states were to base their secession over the
issue of slavery 28 years later. Slavery was an economic
mainstay of agriculture throughout the South,
but particularly so in South Carolina, where slaves
had been imported from Barbados with the very earliest
settlers at Charles Town and where a plantation system
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
based on involuntary servitude had existed since the
late seventeenth century. By the early 1700s African
slaves already made up three-quarters of the South
Carolina population, and on the eve of the Civil War,
South Carolina remained the largest slaveholding state
in the Union. Colleton District, where Middleton Place
was located, was nearly 80% black.</p>
<p>This enormous disparity meant that white slaveholders
lived in constant fear of slave insurrection.
They were equally fearful of emancipation, which, as
abolitionist sentiment grew in the North, many planters
came to view as an inevitable outcome of northern
political dominance. There were slaveholders who
staunchly opposed disunion, but South Carolina, as it
had been during the nullification dispute, was a hotbed
of secessionism. With the 1860 election of Abraham
Lincoln, a Charleston convention passed an ordinance
making South Carolina the first state to withdraw
from the Union. Henry Middleton had died in
1846 before the slavery controversy reached its
height, but among the signers of the Ordinance of
Secession were his sons John Izard Middleton of
Georgetown, and Williams Middleton of Middleton Place.</p>
<p>The war that followed caused more devastation to
the plantation economy than emancipation, for in defeat
the planters lost most of their financial assets
and their voice in local government. In areas that
had witnessed military action, they often saw devastation
of their homes and property. Middleton Place,
plundered and burned by invading troops in 1865, was
no exception. Williams and his family fled to
Charleston where they lived while renting the plantation
grounds to a &ldquo;Yankee captain.&rdquo; In 1867 Williams
borrowed money from a sister in Philadelphia and began
the task of restoring the burnt-out southern flanker
building to serve as a family residence. In 1871,
before repairs were complete, the Middletons and their
two children were again living at Middleton Place in
the shadow of the ruined mansion that had housed five
generations of their family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<p>Restoration of the plantation&rsquo;s agricultural
operations, however, proved more difficult. The tidal
rice fields, which required constant maintenance, had
been neglected, and the loss of the more than 100
slaves who had worked the plantation grounds and rice
fields left Williams without the necessary labor for
large-scale cultivation. Although vastly diminished
quantities of rice continued to be harvested elsewhere
in the lowcountry, Middleton Place apparently never
again produced a successful rice crop. By 1890 rice
from Louisiana, where flat upland fields permitted
mechanized cultivation impossible in the South Carolina
marshes, had begun to drive Carolina rice off the
market. Today no rice at all is grown in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Two new commodities that gained importance in the
land-poor lowcountry economy were phosphates, of which
postbellum South Carolina was the nation&rsquo;s leading
supplier, and timber, an important product in the
Southeast. Williams turned his hand to exploitation
of these natural resources, and by 1878, Middleton
Place boasted both phosphate mines and a sawmill.
Although he and his heirs continued to lease the plantation
timber and mineral rights until the early twentieth
century, by 1880 the aging Williams had left
Middleton Place, taking up residence in Greenville,
South Carolina. After Williams died in 1882, his wife
Susan made regular visits to the plantation. But following
her death in 1900, Middleton Place lay abandoned,
except for periodic visits, for over 20 years.
Williams and Susan&rsquo;s son Henry, who had left South
Carolina in the 1870s to attend Cambridge University,
was living in England, and their daughter Elizabeth
had married and settled in Greenville.</p>
<p>The plantation was inherited by a cousin, J. J.
Pringle Smith, who, in 1925, moved his family into the
southern flanker house and began the slow job of restoring
the Middleton Place grounds and gardens.
Pringle Smith built the present stableyard complex on
the site of older outbuildings, installed an electrical
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
generator in the former privy building, and opened
the gardens to the public. In 1970 Middleton Place
became a Registered National Historic Landmark under
the management of the Smiths&rsquo; grandson, Charles Duell.
In 1975, with the creation of the Middleton Place
Foundation, the south flanker containing many of the
family&rsquo;s original furnishings was also opened to the
public.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">ARCHEOLOGY AT MIDDLETON PLACE</span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" id="ncfig2" alt="uncaptioned" width="800" height="611" />
</div>
<p>Modern historical archeology, like archeology in
general, is based on two main premises. First, where
man has lived for any length of time, he has left
behind artifacts&mdash;bits of food, broken pottery, tools,
and ornaments&mdash;that tell us something of his way of
life. Second, human behavior is, to a certain extent,
patterned and predictable, and similar artifacts will
be found on similar sites. Thus, even if two household
sites are separated by hundreds of years of technological
innovation, they may yield utensils used for
roughly the same purposes. If two contemporary sites
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
produce artifacts of the same style and workmanship,
then their inhabitants shared at least some aspects of
a single culture, and variations between the sites can
provide valuable clues to adaptations of that culture
to different circumstances.</p>
<p>The distinction between prehistoric and historical
archeology is based not on differences in technology
but on the presence or absence of written records.
While prehistoric archeologists reconstruct
ancient cultures primarily from artifactual evidence,
historical archeology employs both documents and material
remains to study literate societies and the pre-literate
populations whom they influenced. In much of
Europe and Asia, the historic period begins centuries
before Christ, but in North America, historical archeology
is concerned with the period of recorded European
exploration and occupation extending from the
sixteenth century to the present.</p>
<p>From these four centuries we have innumerable
written records covering a vast array of subjects.
But although these records contain a wealth of information,
they cannot always be trusted to be either
thorough or accurate. In addition, historians are
often most interested in aspects of daily life&mdash;such
as health, diet, and the living conditions of the
unlettered poor&mdash;that are frequently omitted altogether
from written records. By examining the record
of activities that people have left in the soil, archeology
can provide written history with a comparatively
unbiased account of the economic conditions
underlying historical change.</p>
<p>Probably the most obvious indicators of past
living conditions are buildings, around which most
human activities are centered. On most historic sites
these include not only residences but also a variety
of outbuildings such as privies, barns, and work
buildings that are crucial to understanding the site
as a whole. This is especially true of such complex
institutions as plantations, where hundreds of people
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
may have lived and worked over an area of many acres.
Since many of these buildings have long since disappeared,
the first task of the excavator is to find
them by tracing the concentrations of debris that,
fortunately for archeologists, our ancestors scattered
freely around their dwellings and workplaces.</p>
<p>The Middleton Place privy is a modest one-story
building half hidden in live oaks behind the Middleton
House museum. It has outlasted many of its more imposing
contemporaries to become one of the oldest
standing structures at Middleton Place. Built in the
late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, the privy
was one of the few plantation buildings to escape
destruction by Sherman&rsquo;s troops in 1865. In its long
lifetime it has served as an outdoor latrine, a generator
house, and a storage building. Now, newly
equipped with running water and flush toilets, it is
the only antebellum building at Middleton Place still
serving the purpose for which it was constructed.</p>
<p>An outdoor privy may seem an unlikely place to
conduct an archeological excavation. Much eighteenth
and nineteenth century trash was simply tossed out the
back door, but the backyard privy, ready made for
waste disposal and usually handily located a few dozen
feet from the house, also received its share of household
disposables. As a privy pit neared abandonment,
the top layers were often stuffed with broken objects
before it was sealed and a new hole dug.</p>
<p>The privy is set solidly atop a rectangular
brick-lined pit, which house servants kept open and
functioning for more than 100 years with a system of
&ldquo;honey buckets.&rdquo; When the privy was finally abandoned
in the 1920s, the entire pit, not just the top few
inches, was packed with broken or unusable household
goods.</p>
<p>The privy pit was sealed by J. J. Pringle Smith,
who laid a concrete floor in the privy building and
converted it into a shed for the plantation&rsquo;s first
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
electric generator. With the subsequent arrival of
outside electrical power, the generator too was abandoned,
and the privy stood undisturbed for the next 40
years. In 1978 workmen remodeling the building into a
modern restroom broke through the concrete floor to
the artifact-laden pit below. The artifacts were excavated
and analyzed by archeologists from the University
of South Carolina&rsquo;s Institute of Archeology
and Anthropology, and are now on display in the Middleton
Place Spring House Museum.</p>
<p>Privy pits, being relatively shallow, normally
contain objects accumulated and discarded within a
very few years. The Middleton privy, only three feet
deep, was expected to be no exception. Once the artifacts
had been cleaned and restored, however, it became
apparent that this was no short-term kitchen
deposit, but a diverse assemblage of objects spanning
more than 100 years of the plantation&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>A sealed archeological deposit can date no earlier
than its most recent artifact, and a handful of
twentieth century utility bottles confirmed that this
chronological hodgepodge had been thrown into the
privy pit shortly after the arrival of the Pringle
Smith family in 1925. The scarcity of items from the
Smiths&rsquo; period of residence, however, suggested that
the family had filled the privy not with their own
trash but with objects accumulated by the Middletons
in the preceding century. The artifacts could not
have collected in the house before 1871, when the
Middletons moved back to their war-ravaged estate, or
after 1900, when Susan Middleton&rsquo;s death ended the
plantation&rsquo;s role as a regular residence. The artifacts
left in the house spanned Susan and her husband&rsquo;s
entire lifetimes, from the costly dinnerwares
of the wealthy planter to the plain stone china of his
widow. As much as any exhibit at Middleton Place,
then, the artifacts on display in the Spring House
Museum bear testimony to the cycle of wealth and poverty,
prosperity and decay, that characterized the
nineteenth century Middletons and their plantation.</p>

<p>The Industrial Revolution introduced an era of
mass production, technological efficiency, and mass
consumption. One of its minor miracles was the perfection
of a hard-boiled white ceramic that was within
the financial reach of most of the population. Though
hardly striking to the modern eye, the white ironstone
plates pictured below (<a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>) are the result of years
of experimentation by British and other European potters.
In durability, purity of color, and cost-effectiveness,
the everyday ironstones and granitewares of
the late nineteenth century represent a triumph of
western ceramic technology that has been little improved
upon since the earlier part of that century.
(See <a href="#c7">Appendix 1</a> for a complete listing and illustrations
of ceramic manufacturers&rsquo; marks.)</p>
<p>The impetus for this technological marvel goes
back to the global expansionism of Europe&rsquo;s seafaring
nations in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Among the exotica brought back by early traders was
Chinese porcelain, an impermeable white ceramic ware
unlike anything produced in Europe. As trade with the
Orient grew, so did importation of Chinese porcelain.
By the eighteenth century, Chinese potters were regularly
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
turning out blue-and-white &ldquo;export porcelain&rdquo;
(<a href="#fig3">Fig. 3</a>) made specifically for the European market.
East India Company ships were transporting it to England
as &ldquo;flooring&rdquo; to protect perishable cargoes of
tea.</p>

</div>
<p>Much of this porcelain found its way to the American
colonies. In the early colonial period, Chinese
porcelain was a relatively rare and prestigious ware
associated with the upper-class custom of afternoon
tea. By the time of the American Revolution, both
tea-drinking and porcelain had spread to the lower
classes. When American merchants opened their own
direct trade with China in the 1780s, they brought
back large quantities of porcelain along with the more
lucrative teas and silks. By the 1820s Chinese
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
blue-and-white had become an ordinary household
fixture and, with a concomitant decline in quality of
production, began to lose favor with the American
buyer. Very little was imported after the early
1830s.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to overestimate the influence
of Oriental porcelain on the European ceramic
industry. Europeans greatly admired the hardness,
whiteness, and thinness of the Chinese imports, and
many of the most important developments in eighteenth
and nineteenth century ceramic manufacture resulted
from a conscious effort to imitate these qualities.
Soft paste porcelain, made by adding glass to the clay
body, was an early attempt to reproduce the porcelain
paste itself. The Germans discovered the secret of
true hard paste porcelain around 1710 and began producing
it at Meissen three years later, followed by
the Austrians at Vienna in 1718 and the French at
S&egrave;vres in 1768. Early European porcelains imitated
the Oriental in design as well as paste, but after
about mid-century, chinoiseries gave way to flowers
and other European designs executed in a variety of
colors. Through the end of the century, European
porcelain remained an art form available only to the
well-to-do. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows a French porcelain tea
plate hand-painted in the &ldquo;Bourbon Sprig&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cornflower&rdquo;
pattern of scattered flowers popular during
the reign of Louis XVI. Probably produced in Paris in
the eighteenth or early nineteenth century, this plate
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
was part of a large set of Bourbon Sprig china originally
brought from Europe by a member of the Middleton
family after 1820.</p>

</div>
<p>Little hard paste porcelain was produced in England,
where bone china, a somewhat softer porcelain
with calcined ox bone added to the paste, became a
favorite material for expensive dinnerwares. Oriental
influence on British ceramics was more immediately
felt in the British decorative style, which through
the nineteenth century continued to borrow heavily
from the Chinese and Japanese. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> illustrates
an English porcelain platter decorated in the colorful
pseudo-Oriental motif typical of early nineteenth
century dinner services. These services, often made
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
in stone china or ironstone, sometimes included as
many as two hundred pieces to accommodate the lavish
dinner parties that were the fashionable entertainment
of the day.</p>

</div>
<p>A more significant effect of Oriental porcelain
on British ceramics was the revolution it inspired in
the production of everyday earthenware. From the
early eighteenth century, British potters had sought
to develop a smooth white-bodied earthenware that
could be made from local clays to compete with the
imported blue-and-white. The first real breakthrough
in this endeavor came in the 1760s, when Josiah Wedgwood,
the giant of British ceramic history, began production
of a thinly potted pale yellow pottery known
as creamware or queensware (<a href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>). Dozens of British
factories quickly took up manufacture of creamware,
and it became a staple dinnerware throughout
Europe and America. It remained a popular British and
American tableware until the 1820s, after which it
degenerated into a common utilitarian crockery. Known
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
as &ldquo;C.C. ware,&rdquo; creamware finished out the nineteenth
century as the cheapest of the heavy utility wares,
used chiefly for such items as mixing bowls and
chamber pots.</p>
<p>On the heels of creamware came pearlware, another
Wedgwood invention that consisted of a slightly
whiter-bodied ceramic, which, with the addition of a
clear blue-tinted glaze, came close to approximating
the pearly bluish white of Oriental porcelain. The
development of pearlware, and the even whiter earthenwares
that followed, ushered in the great British
period of blue transfer-printing that lasted from the
1780s through the 1840s. The art of printing glazed
ceramics with designs transferred from engraved copper
plates had been known since the 1750s, but the more
durable underglaze process was developed only in the
1770s&mdash;and then only in cobalt blue, the one color
that consistently remained unblurred through the high
firing temperatures required for glazing. Blue underglaze
printing had been tried to no one&rsquo;s satisfaction
on the yellow background of creamware, but pearlware,
with its faint bluish tint, was the first earthenware
that was both hard enough and of a suitable color for
the new technique. Despite the development of nearly
pure white earthenwares in the early 1800s, British
potters continued throughout the nineteenth century to
add the blue-tinted pearlware glaze to earthenwares of
many different compositions.</p>
<p>Early transfer patterns imitated the Chinese and
were engraved into the copper plates in a series of
deep lines, but a technique combining lines and stippling,
which allowed for greater detail and shading,
was introduced about 1810. With this and other developments,
Oriental designs gave way to pastoral and
architectural scenes&mdash;English, Alpine, Italianate, and
American, among many others&mdash;usually surrounded by
borders of English flowers (<a href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a>). In later years,
many of these scenes were printed in various colors
made possible by the introduction of new dyes in the
late 1820s, but blue remained the most popular color
through the end of the transfer-printing era in the
late 1840s.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>The dinnerware that pre-empted transfer-printed
earthenware was plain stone china of the sort pictured
in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. Late nineteenth century stone china,
also known as ironstone, graniteware, and semi-porcelain,
was not a new ceramic but a variant of the
stone chinas and ironstones first produced by Josiah
Spode and Charles Mason in the first two decades of
the century. The novelty of the stone chinas sold
after 1840 lay in the new inexpensive methods of mass-producing
them, and in their hitherto unthinkable
absence of painted decoration. Early nineteenth century
stone chinas had been elaborately decorated with
Oriental wildlife and transfer-printed patterns, but
by mid-century it was almost all stark white, with
only embossed or molded decoration. After about 1870,
it was often produced with no decoration at all.</p>
<p>Stone china at its best was nearly unbreakable,
and thus admirably suited to life in the still rough-and-ready
American states. Like earlier wares, most
of the stone china sold in the United States was imported
from Great Britain. The fledgling American
pottery industry did not begin producing hard-paste
whitewares until after 1860, and throughout the nineteenth
century American-made ironstone was considered
inferior to imported china. Much of the early American
potter&rsquo;s energy went into the production of common
utility items, which, like the probably American-made
chamberpot in <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>, were often unmarked to hide
their domestic origins.</p>
<p>At the opposite extreme of the decorative scale
was English majolica, a gaudily painted ware introduced
by Minton &amp; Co. at the 1851 &ldquo;Great Exhibition&rdquo;
in London (<a href="#fig9">Fig. 9</a>). Early Minton majolica was intended
as an imitation of sixteenth century Italian
majolica and featured hand-painted romantic scenes on
an opaque white background. The style quickly
evolved, however, into a fancifully molded pottery
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
decorated with a wide range of colorful semitranslucent
glazes. Produced by a number of factories
after about 1860, majolica was used through the end of
the century both for inexpensive domestic items and
for sometimes massive ornamental objects such as jardinieres.</p>

molded into shapes resembling trees or

</div>
<p>Manufacture of European porcelain had not ceased
during the years British earthenware dominated the
American ceramic market, but the nature of the product
had changed considerably. The French porcelain industry,
in particular, had evolved from a restricted
craft patronized by royalty to a number of independently
owned factories turning out standardized dinnerwares
for the public taste. These relatively inexpensive
wares appealed to Americans as well as Europeans,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
and French porcelains were imported in quantity
beginning around 1850. To Americans, the most prestigious
French porcelain came from Limoges, where a
number of factories had clustered to take advantage of
extensive kaolin deposits. Of Limoges porcelain, the
most highly regarded was that produced by Haviland &amp;
Co., a firm founded in 1842 by an American china merchant,
David Haviland, to produce porcelain, specifically
designed for the American market (<a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>).
Cheaper French porcelains, often with no manufacturer&rsquo;s
mark, were sturdily and heavily made in an apparent
attempt to capture the white ironstone dinnerware
market.</p>

</div>
<p>Despite its popularity, French porcelain did not
succeed in replacing white ironstone in the American
cupboard. That remained for German and Austrian
porcelain (<a href="#fig11">Fig. 11</a>), an even cheaper ware that began
to enter the country in quantity around 1875, and in
prodigious amounts after the turn of the century.
Much admired for their thinness and translucency,
these delicate dinnerwares easily undersold not only
ironstone and the established French and British porcelains,
but the then fashionable pressed glass tableware
sets as well. Like most porcelains of the period,
Austrian and German dinner sets were usually decorated
with small sprays of naturalistic flowers. This design
was made easier by the late nineteenth century
development of decal-printing, or &ldquo;decalcomania,&rdquo; a
process by which multicolored paper patterns are
transferred directly onto the surface of a glazed
ceramic. Decal-printing was first used on European
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
ceramics around 1900, and it remains a popular ceramic
decoration today.</p>
<p>Most of the popular Austrian porcelains were
manufactured near Carlsbad in Bohemia, which after
World War I became a part of modern Czechoslovakia.
After World War I Czechoslovakia and other European
countries continued to dominate the American porcelain
market. Although American-made earthenwares and stone
chinas had become a competitive force around the beginning
of the century, it was not until World War II,
and the resulting disruption of the European china
trade, that American porcelain manufacturers were able
to end the tradition of imported ceramics that began
with seventeenth century Chinese porcelain.</p>

<p>Decorative glass recovered in the privy excavation

spanning the entire nineteenth century. Most
of the glass tableware, however, particularly the
heavy cut glass, appears to have been manufactured in
the antebellum period. This indication that the Middletons

until they left the plantation may be an indication of
the family&rsquo;s reduced financial circumstances after the
Civil War. Only a few of the more representative

glass tableware items are illustrated below.</p>

<p>One of the more popular and long-lived methods of
decorating glass has been wheel-cutting, introduced
into England from Germany by the early eighteenth
century, and used primarily on the soft but brilliant
lead glass crystal developed in England around 1675.
Early nineteenth century English cut glass, incised
entirely by hand, tended toward restrained neoclassical
lines, but the introduction of a steam-powered
cutting wheel in 1810 ushered in an era of deep and
extensive cut decoration. Much of this English and
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
Irish cut glass was imported into the United States,
but by the first few decades of the nineteenth century,
American glasshouses had developed a reputation
in the field as well. The cut glass pitcher in <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>
dates from this period and is similar to pitchers
produced in Pennsylvania glasshouses in the 1820s. The
applied hand-tooled handle is of a type seldom used
after the 1860s.</p>

<p>By the 1830s cutting in flat vertical slices, or
flutes, had come into fashion. Heavy straight-sided
decanters like the one in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>A were well-suited
to this decoration and remained popular through the
1840s, after which the fashion swung toward lighter
long-necked decanters with rounded bodies. The decanter
on the right with more restrained fluting
around the base only is probably part of a shouldered
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
decanter of a style most common before about 1830.
Victorian glasscutters frequently reproduced older
styles, however, in the thousands of decanters that
were turned off the wheel before decanters ceased to
be an everyday tableware around World War I.</p>
<p>In the late 1820s American glassmakers introduced
the side-lever glass press, a device that could form
wide-mouthed glass items by pressing them against a
mold with a plunger. The glass press allowed mass
production of decorated tableware at a much lower cost
than cutting or engraving, and within a few years
pressed glass had begun to make serious inroads into
the cut glass market. Early American pressed glass
was made in stippled or &ldquo;lacy&rdquo; patterns formed by
closely-spaced small indentations in the mold, but in
the late 1840s, smooth patterns similar to some cut
glass styles had been developed. The invention in
1864 of an inexpensive substitute for the costly lead
glass crystal further reduced the cost of pressed
glass manufacture, and by the 1870s, dozens of factories
were turning out pressed glass table sets in a
staggering array of patterns. These pattern glass
sets remained the most popular American glassware
until the 1880s when cut glass resurfaced with deeply
and ornately incised &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; cut glass.</p>
<p>Pressed glass manufacturers responded to the new
patterns with pressed glass imitations, a single example
of which was recovered from the Middleton Place
privy deposit. Figures <a href="#fig14">14</a> and <a href="#fig15">15</a> show the transition
of styles through the nineteenth century. On the far

an early non-lacy pattern introduced in the 1850s or

&ldquo;Mascotte&rdquo; pattern. This pattern, probably first
produced in the 1880s, was one of the many late nineteenth
century pressed glass patterns made to resemble

<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century, most
bottles in the United States and England were either
free-blown&mdash;formed on the end of a blowpipe without
aid of a mold&mdash;or blown into a one-piece &ldquo;dip mold&rdquo;
that formed only the basic body shape. Neither of
these processes allowed large-scale production of
oddly shaped or embossed containers, and since even
dip-molded bottles were formed by hand above the
shoulder, the bottles tended to be asymmetrical.</p>
<p>Hinged two-piece molds, capable of shaping the
shoulder and neck as well as the body of the bottle,
had occasionally been used in England as early as the
1750s, but they did not become common in the U. S.
until the second and third decades of the nineteenth
century. A three-piece mold with a dip body and
hinged neck and shoulder parts, developed in England
shortly after the turn of the century, was popularized
by an 1821 patent taken out by the Henry Ricketts
Company of Bristol. These two forms, especially the
two-piece mold, remained the most common mold types
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
throughout the nineteenth century. On early two-piece
molds, the pieces were hinged in the center of the
base, but a more stable mold with a separate base part
was developed by the late 1850s and was almost universally
used in the later decades of the century.</p>
<p>On almost all mouth-blown bottles, whether free-blown
or blown in a complex mold, the lip and upper
neck were formed in a separate process after the
otherwise complete article had been removed from the
blowpipe. This process, the last step in the formation
of the bottle, was known as &ldquo;finishing,&rdquo; and the
completed lip came to be called the &ldquo;finish.&rdquo; In the
early part of the nineteenth century, bottles were
finished with simple hand tools such as shears, but by
1840, a specialized &ldquo;lipping tool&rdquo; with a central plug
and one or more rotating external arms had been introduced.
This tool produced a smoother and more uniform
finish, and remained in use until the industry was
fully automated in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>While the finish was being formed, most bottles
were held by an iron pontil rod affixed to the base
with molten glass. This process left a rough scar on
the bottom of the bottle where the pontil had been
detached. Holding devices which gripped the body of
the bottle and eliminated the need for empontilling
were apparently known in England in the 1820s, but did
not become common in American glasshouses until the
1840s or 50s. By the 1870s use of the pontil rod had
almost entirely ceased.</p>
<p>The most significant American contribution to the
early nineteenth century glass industry was the development
in the 1820s of the hand-operated side-lever
pressing machine. This device consisted of a single- or
multi-piece mold into which the glass was pressed
by means of a plunger. Since the plunging process
required wide-mouthed molds, pressing was used primarily
for glass tableware, although straight-sided jars
were also pressed in the later part of the century.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>In 1864 William Leighton of J. H. Hobbs, Brockunier,
&amp; Co. in West Virginia perfected a formula for
an inexpensive soda-based glass that was as crystalline
as the heavy lead glass previously used for most
American-made clear glass items. This new glass revolutionized
the pressed glass tableware industry, and
probably was responsible for the flood of clear glass
medicinal and household bottles that followed the
Civil War. Like earlier clear glass, the improved
lime glass was tinted with manganese oxide to remove
its natural green coloring. Clear glass items manufactured
with manganese tend to turn varying shades of
lavender when left exposed to the sun. Manganese was
imported from Germany in the nineteenth century to
decolor glass and was no longer used after the outbreak
of World War I.</p>
<p>In the immediate post-Civil War period, the
American glass industry expanded rapidly. Molds were
improved and worker and furnace productivity increased
to many times their 1800 level. New bottle shapes
were introduced, and specialized and embossed bottles
proliferated. The manufacture of preserve jars became
a major industry, and a special &ldquo;blow-back&rdquo; mold,
included in John Mason&rsquo;s 1858 fruit jar patent, was
used to form the screw threads for the sealable lids.
Standard bottle shapes for different products became
common, as did uniformly applied standard lip forms
for different purposes. The standard shapes of the
bottles from the Middleton Place privy are shown in
<a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a>. Turnmolding, a long-known method of removing
mold marks by rotating the unfinished bottle in
the mold, became a popular way of manufacturing unblemished
wine bottles. A popular technique of embossing
was plate-molding, an operation in which a personalized
name plate could be inserted into a standard
mold for inexpensive lettering of even small runs of
bottles.</p>

<p>The first mechanized production of bottles in the
United States was on a semiautomatic &ldquo;press-and-blow&rdquo;
machine patented by Philip Argobast in 1881 and used
by the Enterprise Glass Co. of Pittsburgh to make
Vaseline jars in 1893. Although the molten glass
still had to be gathered and dropped into the mold by
hand, the Argobast machine could produce completely
machine-molded wide-mouth jars by pressing the lip and
blowing the body in two separate operations. Semiautomatic
production rapidly took over the fruit jar
industry, and by the turn of the century most fruit
jars were made on semiautomatic machines rather than
in the traditional blow-back molds. Narrow-necked
bottles, however, could not be manufactured on &ldquo;press-and-blow&rdquo;
machines because the plunger for the pressing
operation could not be withdrawn through a narrow
opening. Although a &ldquo;blow-and-blow&rdquo; machine for
narrow-necked bottles was developed in England in the
late 1880s, semiautomatics for small-mouthed ware were
apparently not introduced in the U.S. until after the
development of the automatic Owens bottle machine in
1903.</p>
<p>The Owens machine, invented by Michael J. Owens
of the Toledo Glass Co., was put into production in
1904. It differed from the semiautomatics in that the
glass was gathered into the molds by mechanical suction
process, thus completely eliminating hand labor.
Despite a series of improvements from 1904 to 1911,
the Owens machine was slow to gain acceptance, both
because of its expense and because of the restrictive
licensing policies adopted by the Toledo Glass Co. In
1905 most bottle production other than wide-necked
jars was still by hand. Semiautomatics came into
increasing use, however, and a number of improvements
made them a serious threat to the Owens machine.
After about 1914, there was a proliferation of patents
for automatic feeding devices that could cheaply convert
the more modern semiautomatics into fully automatic
machines. Use of feeder-fed semiautomatics, as
well as the Owens automatic machines, reduced hand
bottle production to 50% of the country&rsquo;s output by
1917, and to less than 10% by 1925. More efficient
feeder machines slowly replaced the Owens-type suction
machines and are the type in general use today.</p>

<p>As glass manufacturing expanded after the Civil
War, so did the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmacology
became a more exact science than it ever had been, and
its practitioners dispensed their compound medicines
in glass bottles that for the first time were available
in precisely graduated sizes and a variety of
shapes often tailored to suit specific products.
Early post-war bottles were usually made in the aquamarine
of &ldquo;green&rdquo; glass that had become traditional
for apothecaries&rsquo; wares, but use of clear lime glass
spread until by the end of the century most pharmacy
bottles, like most of those from the Middleton Place
privy, were made of clear glass.</p>

<p>One of the first of the new shapes was the
&ldquo;French square,&rdquo; a tall bottle with beveled corners
introduced in the early 1860s (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>). The French
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
square was followed by more elaborate rectangular,
round, and oval shapes, many of them adapted with one
or more flat sides to accommodate the paper labels or
plate-molded lettering with which pharmacists usually
marked their wares. The &ldquo;Philadelphia oval&rdquo; shown in
<a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a>C, plate-molded with the name of an 1867-1902
Charleston pharmacy, was a favorite shape.</p>
<p>Despite such advances as Louis Pasteur&rsquo;s bacteriological
discoveries, ideas of medical treatment in
the nineteenth century remained primitive by modern
standards. Without many of the vaccines and antibiotics
now available, people dosed themselves with a
wide range of substances which most twentieth century
invalids would hold in dim regard. For instance,
pharmacists distributed morphine in small bottles such
as that shown in <a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a>E. Vegetable extracts that
would not now be in anybody&rsquo;s pharmacopoeia were often
sold in panel bottles (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>B).</p>
<p>One of the few restrictions placed on the more
dangerous medicaments was packaging. In 1872 the
American Medical Association, concerned over accidental
poisoning, issued a recommendation that potentially
harmful substances be bottled in distinctively
colored containers that were also recognizable by
touch. One result of this directive was blue quilted
poison bottles (<a href="#fig17">Fig. 17</a>D). A specialty of Whitall,
Tatum &amp; Co., a major manufacturer of pharmaceutical
wares, these bottles were manufactured until about
1920. Other companies continued to produce poison
bottles until the 1930s, when it was decided that the
bright colors and fanciful shapes were more an attraction
than a deterrent to children exploring the medicine
cabinet.</p>

<p>A better-known but less savory branch of nineteenth
century medicine was the patent medicine industry,
which exploded into notoriety with its extravagant
use of the new late nineteenth century advertising
techniques. While most patent remedies were alcohol- or
narcotic-based frauds, the term patent medicine
meant simply any medicine sold without a prescription
and included a number of legitimate and
effective over-the-counter remedies. The 1906 Pure
Food and Drug Act and subsequent acts of Congress were
intended to control dangerous substances and put an
end to spurious advertising claims, and resulted in
the alteration or removal from the market of many
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
patent medicines. Others, such as Bromo-Seltzer,
survived the legislation and continued to be sold for
years.</p>
<p>Most patent medicines were in fact not patented,
for that would have meant revealing the formula to
competitors and consumers alike. Nevertheless, the
nature of many of the more potent over-the-counter
remedies was not entirely unknown. Hostetter&rsquo;s Bitters,
for example, was regulated by the South Carolina
Dispensary along with whiskey and beer.</p>
<p>Only three patent medicine bottles were recovered
from the Middleton Place privy deposit, and all appear
to have been rather tame digestive remedies of the
sort that might be sold today. The amber bottle on
the left (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>A) contained Maltine, probably a
digestive and nutritional supplement rather than a
cure. The blue bottle (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>B), the same shape that
was later used for Bromo-Seltzer, probably contained
Bromo-Caffeine, an antacid and laxative whose main
ingredient was magnesia. Bromo-Caffeine was the principal
product of the Keasbey &amp; Mattison Co., which
operated in Philadelphia from 1873 to 1882, and in
Ambler, Pennsylvania, from 1882 to 1962. The blue-green
bottle (<a href="#fig18">Fig. 18</a>E) contained Horsford&rsquo;s Acid
Phosphate of Lime, a phosphate-based preparation sold
by the Rumford Chemical Works of Providence, Rhode
Island, from 1868 until at least the turn of the century.
On later bottles, however, the company name
reads from top to bottom rather than from bottom to
top.</p>
<p>The predecessor to these sturdy containers was a
thin-walled cylindrical bottle used by the apothecaries
and pharmacists of the eighteenth and early nineteenth
centuries (<a href="#fig19">Fig. 19</a>). All free-blown or dip-molded,
these bottles were used as late as the 1850s,
and because of the Civil War, perhaps even later in
some parts of the South. The two bottle bases at
right are turned up to show the blow-pipe pontil scar
made by holding the bottle with a blow-pipe while its
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
neck and lip were formed. The long neck on the right
is probably not from a cylindrical bottle but from a
globular flask that was used in larger sizes for wine
and other beverages, and in smaller sizes for medicines
and essences. The style of its collar dates
this bottle to after about 1820.</p>

<p>Perhaps the oldest use for glass bottles has been
the storage and transport of alcohol. Some of the
oldest bottles from the Middleton Place privy are wine
and spirits bottles. Bottles made in the same dark
green glass as the three pictured below left were used
by the earliest colonists for various wines and spirits,
and, although the bottle shapes have varied over
the centuries, the tradition continues in the green
wine bottles of the present day.</p>
<p>With the improvement of glassmaking techniques in
the nineteenth century, alcohol bottles became more
diverse and specialized. Although a simple cylindrical
bottle (<a href="#fig20">Fig. 20</a>B) remained a standard for various
types of spirits, flasks, like those later used by the
South Carolina Dispensary (Fig. <a href="#fig22">22</a>B and C), became
more and more common for whiskey. Beer bottles developed
a distinctive shape (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>), and different
shapes evolved for different types of wines. <a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>A
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>

nineteenth century for the sauternes and clarets of
the French Bordeaux district. The amber miniature
shown in <a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a>D is a two-ounce sample bottle of
the shape normally used for German Rhine wines. By
the beginning of the twentieth century, most types of
alcohol bottles could be purchased in miniature sizes
for use in advertising and promotion.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">BEER BOTTLES</span></h2>
<p>The three late nineteenth century bottles shown
below represent one of the oldest pastimes in America.
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Until the late nineteenth century, however, most
American beers were locally produced ales, stouts, and
porters that were not bottled but sold in kegs to
taverns. Modern lager beer was first introduced by
German immigrants in the 1840s, but it was not until
the 1870s that the expanding railway system, together
with the food preservation techniques developed by
Louis Pasteur in 1870, made it feasible to brew and
bottle lager beer for a nationwide market.</p>

</div>
<p>Lager beer was less alcoholic but more effervescent
than earlier beers. Increased bottling of lager
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
and carbonated soft drinks spurred the search for new
bottle seals capable of withstanding more pressure
than the traditional cork, which was subject to leakage
and had to be tied down to prevent its popping out
altogether. Two of the most successful of the dozens
of stoppers patented in the decades following 1870
were Henry Putnam&rsquo;s levered 1882 Lightning stopper
(<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>A), and William Painter&rsquo;s 1892 crown cap (<a href="#fig21">Fig. 21</a>B),
the closure still used on most beer bottles.</p>
<p>With these and other developments, production of
bottled &ldquo;export&rdquo; lager increased rapidly through the
1880s and 1890s. Keeping pace with the growth of the
beer industry, however, was the group that was to
prove its undoing: the American temperance movement.
The temperance movement became an organized lobbying
force with the 1893 founding of the Anti-Saloon
League, and thereafter exerted increasing pressure on
Congress and the state legislatures. &ldquo;Dry&rdquo; agitation
in South Carolina led to the implementation from 1893
to 1907 of a statewide dispensary system to control
distribution of beer, wine, and spirits; by 1916,
South Carolina and 22 other states had prohibited all
sale of non-medicinal alcohol. National wartime legislation
banned the manufacture of distilled spirits in
1917 and beer and wine in 1918. The Volstead Act of
1919 extended this ban until the eighteenth amendment
forbidding the production or sale of any beverage with
more than .5% alcohol could take effect in January
1920.</p>
<p>Prohibition completely changed the face of the
American brewing industry and almost completely destroyed
the tradition of the small local brewer. Many
brewers tried to survive by selling soft drinks and
&ldquo;near beer,&rdquo; a lager with less than .5% alcohol.
&ldquo;Near beer,&rdquo; however, could not stand up to the competition
of home brewers and bootleggers, and most
breweries either turned to the manufacture of other
products or closed down altogether. Two months after
the sale of wine and beer was again permitted in
April, 1933, only 31 breweries had reopened. In 1940,
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
seven years after the lifting of all national restrictions
on alcohol, beer production finally reached its
pre-Prohibition level, but the number of breweries in
operation was less than half the number in 1910.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">SOUTH CAROLINA DISPENSARY BOTTLES</span></h2>
<p>The South Carolina Dispensary system, in operation
from 1893 to 1907, was a nearly unique and completely
unsuccessful attempt to control alcohol abuse
by placing a state&rsquo;s entire retail liquor trade into
the hands of its government. Touted by its sponsor,
Governor &ldquo;Pitchfork Ben&rdquo; Tillman, as a means of encouraging
temperance, guaranteeing purity of product,
and returning alcohol revenues to the citizens, the
dispensary was born as an eleventh hour compromise
between pro- and anti-Prohibition forces in the state
legislature. The measure as enacted satisfied neither
side, and the dispensary remained a volatile issue in
state politics until its repeal 14 years later.</p>
<p>The system functioned by buying up wholesale
spirits from local and out-of-state manufacturers,
repackaging or relabeling them at a Columbia distribution
center, and retailing them to the public through
locally operated dispensaries. Beer, which was never
bottled by the dispensary, was sold privately under
special license, and alcohol of any sort could be
brought into the state for individual consumption. In
the beginning, all liquors were sold in special dispensary
bottles, but by the turn of the century, the
dispensary was handling hundreds of products, many of
them pre-packaged national brands.</p>
<p>Litigation and often violent public resistance
(an 1894 &ldquo;whiskey rebellion&rdquo; left three dead) plagued
the system in its early years. By 1905 the internal
corruption had become so pervasive that a legislative
investigating committee recommended closing the system
as unmanageable. Despite the now-handsome profit that
it was returning to the state treasury, the South
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
Carolina dispensary was abolished by the Carey-Cothran
Act of the state legislature in 1907.</p>
<p>South Carolina Dispensary bottles came in three
basic shapes: Union flasks, Jo-Jo flasks, and cylindrical
bottles and jugs. Bottles made before 1899
were embossed with palmetto trees (<a href="#fig22">Fig. 22</a>A and C),
and those made after 1899, when public disapproval
forced the removal of the state symbol from liquor
bottles, were embossed with an intertwined SCD monogram.
Bottles were manufactured for the dispensary by
over 20 different glass factories, but after 1902 all
but one brief contract went to the Carolina Glass
Company of Columbia.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">FOOD CONTAINERS</span></h2>
<p>Although olive oil, pickles, and other foods that
do not require sterilization have been packed in glass
and ceramic containers for centuries, the preserving
of hot foods in airtight glass or metal containers is
a comparatively recent development. Housewives in the
eighteenth century knew how to preserve fruits by
boiling them in glass jars that were subsequently
corked and sealed with wax, glue, or pitch, but the
idea of canning as we know it was popularized by
Nicholas Appert, a French confectioner who in 1809 won
a prize from Napoleon for his method of keeping food
fresh for soldiers in the field. Appert succeeded in
preserving over 50 kinds of food, including meats and
vegetables, and published an essay detailing his
method of boiling food in a wide-mouthed jar and sealing
it with a firmly driven cork. The process was
quickly copied in England and America, where seafood,
fruit, and pickles were first packed for wholesale in
New York and Boston about 1820.</p>
<p>A major problem with Appert&rsquo;s method of preserving
in glass was the irregular finish of hand-made
bottles, which often prevented the cork stopper from
forming an absolutely airtight seal. For commercial
packers, an early and lasting solution was the tin-plated
canister, patented in England in 1810 and in
the United States in 1825. An inexpensive and effective
closure for glass containers had to await John
Mason&rsquo;s 1858 patent of the threaded jar seal, which
consisted of a molded screw thread that allowed the
cap to seal on the shoulder rather than the uneven lip
of the jar. Home canners still use a similar screw-top
jar today.</p>
<p>Many Americans, both civilian and military, had
their first taste of commercially canned foods during
the Civil War. Increasing varieties of meats and
vegetables were packed in tin cans in the late nineteenth
century, but glass bottles remained&mdash;and still
remain&mdash;chiefly the package of condiments, sauces, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
other foods that require a reclosable cap.</p>
<p>These limited uses can nonetheless result in a
large number of empty containers. Food bottles are
usually one of the most numerous items found in a
household trash heap. At Middleton Place, only four
of a total of seventy-seven bottles were food containers,
and all had originally held the preserves,
flavorings, and oils that are usually packaged in
glass. <a href="#fig23">Figure 23</a>A shows a &ldquo;One-pound American preserve,&rdquo;
a jar sold at the turn of the century by at
least one glass company, and <a href="#fig23">Figure 23</a>B is a typical
late nineteenth/early twentieth century olive oil bottle.
<a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a> shows both the excavated example and a

<p>This final group of bottles and jars have nothing
in common except their date. The two clear glass bottles
at left are standard desktop ink bottles made
after the 1904 introduction of the Owens bottle machine
and before screw top inks replaced the corked
variety around 1930 (<a href="#fig25">Fig. 25</a>). The conical ink in the
center was one of the earliest shapes for desk-top ink
bottles, introduced when ink was first bottled in
small individual containers in the 1840s. The contents
of the ointment jar at right, made after 1916,
are unknown. Patent records indicate that the May 15,
1916, date was neither a trademark registration nor a
patent issue. It may be a false patent date, put on
the bottle to lend the contents an air of legitimacy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>Although other artifacts, such as the Austrian
porcelain in <a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a> and the beef extract jar in
<a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a>, may have been manufactured in the twentieth
century, these three containers were the only items in
the privy pit that were definitely made after Susan
Middleton&rsquo;s 1900 abandonment of the plantation. As
such, they were the only evidence archeologists had
that these nineteenth century objects were probably
deposited in the twentieth century. All three are
items likely to have been in use at the time of the
Smith family&rsquo;s 1925 move to Middleton Place, and they
were probably discarded at that time.</p>

<p>In 1859, drillers in Pennsylvania brought in the
nation&rsquo;s first producing oil well, an event that was
to alter radically the lives of generations of Americans.
The first revolution achieved by this versatile
new fuel was not in mechanical power, but in lighting.
A working oil field made possible the manufacture of
kerosene, a promising coal and petroleum-based illuminant
that had been patented in New York in 1854 but
had not been put into production because of the scarcity
of one of its principal ingredients. Kerosene
burned more brightly, steadily, and efficiently than
almost any known fuel except gas, which suffered from
the twin disadvantages of requiring immovable fixtures
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
in the wall or ceiling, and of being generally unavailable
outside large urban areas. The abundance of
petroleum from the Pennsylvania fields made kerosene
one of the cheapest fuels available, and by the mid-1860s,
its use had far outstripped that of gas lighting.
In many rural areas, it remained the only practical
form of household lighting until electrification
of these areas in the 1930s.</p>

adjustable student or reading lamp (Figs. <a href="#fig26">26</a> and <a href="#fig27">27</a>),
an 1863 Prussian invention used through the early
twentieth century. In the 1880s decorated lamp chimneys
came into fashion. One of the earliest, simplest,
and most enduring of these styles was the familiar
&ldquo;pearl top&rdquo; chimney rim, patented by the George
A. Macbeth Company in 1883 (<a href="#fig28">Fig. 28</a>). Similar crimped
rims were produced by the Thomas Evans Company, which
in 1899 merged with Macbeth to become, by virtue of a
semiautomatic lamp chimney machine, the nation&rsquo;s largest
glass chimney manufacturer. Demand for glass
lamp chimneys was curtailed by the spread of electric
power in the early twentieth century, and, although it
continued in production, the lamp chimney industry did
not fully mechanize until after the 1920s.</p>

</div>
<p>The artifacts from the Middleton Place privy
present a unique opportunity to observe one aspect of
this plantation&rsquo;s past. This collection of ceramics,
bottles, and other items constitute the refuse discarded
by the occupants of Middleton Place following
the Civil War. It reflects their needs and tastes and
represents an unconscious record of activities a century
ago. Artifacts in the collection include items
from an earlier time as well as things purchased
throughout the last half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>These materials also reveal much about the
privy&rsquo;s history. When compared with collections discarded
around contemporary buildings, the artifacts
from Middleton Place are similar to those often associated
with abandoned buildings. The artifacts in the
Middleton Place privy, then, are likely to have been
deposited there, not as the result of day-to-day living,
but as a consequence of cleaning out the rubbish
of the house&rsquo;s earlier occupants. We may identify the
privy artifacts as a collection of items accumulated
during a time of refurbishing as in the 1920s when J.
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
J. Pringle Smith moved into the family residence and
began restoring it.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 30. Many hours are spent in the
laboratory conserving and studying the
artifacts.</p>
</div>
<p>Although interesting and informative as individual
objects, the privy artifacts are much more informative
as an &ldquo;assemblage&rdquo; resulting from past activities.
The archeologist must study assemblages, like
pieces of a puzzle, to reconstruct, interpret, and
explain past events that produced them. It is important
to record carefully all the artifacts found together
as well as their relationships to one another
and to the deposit from which they were removed.
Artifacts taken from the ground without proper recording
are removed from their archeological context,
and the information they hold is forever lost. Aimless
&ldquo;treasure&rdquo; digging has destroyed much of our historical
heritage. The Middleton Place privy collection
illustrates how proper care, recording, and analysis
can reveal new information. With foresight and
planning, archeology can increase knowledge of the
past for ourselves and for future generations.</p>

<br />MARKS LEFT BY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES OF BOTTLE MANUFACTURE</h2>
<p>Free-blown bottles usually date before the second
half of the nineteenth century and are characterized
by an absence of mold lines of any sort. Because no
molds were used, these bottles are often asymmetrical.
Dip-molded bottles, or bottles molded for basic body
shape below the shoulder, are also generally pre-Civil
War and can only tentatively be distinguished from
free-blown bottles by their symmetry below the shoulder
and a slight tapering from shoulder to base.
Bottles blown in a two-piece mold have mold lines
extending up two opposite sides, usually to just below
the tooled lip. On early nineteenth century bottles
of this sort, the mold lines continue across the center
of the base, but after the 1850s, most two-piece
molds had a separate base part, either a cup bottom,
in which the seam encircled the outer edge of the
base, or a post bottom, which left a circular seam on
the bottom of the bottle. Most bottles from the Middleton
Place privy were blown in two-piece molds with
cup bottoms.</p>
<p>The three-piece mold leaves a single horizontal
line around the shoulder of the bottle, and vertical
lines extending up either side of the shoulder. The
height of these lines can vary from partway up the
shoulder to nearly to the top of the neck. A turn-molded
bottle has been rotated in the mold to erase
mold marks and will exhibit faint horizontal scratches
and striations on the body and neck.</p>
<p>Embossing, very popular after the Civil War,
usually consists of the name of a company or product
printed in raised letters on the sides or base of the
bottle. Isolated numbers and letters on or just above
the base are usually, but not always, mold numbers
used by the manufacturer for identification. Embossed
letters are sometimes carved into the body of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
mold, but for smaller runs a plate mold, with a removable
lettered plate on one or more sides, was used.</p>
<p>Mold lines on bottles finished with a specialized
lipping tool are usually obliterated by faint horizontal
striations extending to about a quarter inch below
the lip. The two-piece blow-back mold, however,
leaves mold seams to the very edge of the lip, and a
lip surface that has been ground smooth rather than
shaped with a lipping tool.</p>
<p>A pontil mark is a circular scar left on the base
by the iron rod used to hold the bottle for finishing
the neck and lip. Although there are many different
methods of empontilling, only two types of marks were
found on bottles from the Middleton Place privy. One
is a &ldquo;sand pontil mark,&rdquo; a roughened grainy area covering
most of the base, apparently the result of dipping
the glasscoated pontil iron in sand before attaching
it. The other is a &ldquo;blow-pipe pontil mark,&rdquo;
which results from empontilling a bottle with the same
pipe that was used to blow it. A blow-pipe mark is a
distinct ring of glass the same size as the bottle
neck.</p>
<p>Pressed glass is formed with a plunger in a mold
on one or more pieces. Pressed glass items are comparatively
thick-walled, have smooth molded lips, usually
with mold seams, and often are distinguished by a
short, straight shear mark, like an isolated mold
line, on the inside base. This mark is from the severing
of the &ldquo;gob&rdquo; of glass before it is dropped into
the mold. Bottles that are made on either automatic
or semi-automatic machines will have mold lines encircling
the top of the lip, as well as on the sides
and base.</p>

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
